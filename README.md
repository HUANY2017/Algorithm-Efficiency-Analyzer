# Algorithm-Efficiency-Analyzer

### Project Description:

The Algorithm Efficiency Analyzer allows users to input a list of numbers, select a sorting algorithm, and visualize its efficiency via a GUI interface. The project tasks include implementing sorting algorithms in Python, developing an interactive GUI, visualizing data, and testing. Resources include tkinter for GUI development and matplotlib for data visualization. This project aims to enhance understanding of algorithm efficiency, GUI design, and data visualization.
